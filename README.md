## Data Mining - CSC 84040: Project One, Basic Data Analysis and Visualization

#### Data Source:
* Twitter US Airline Sentiment Kaggle Dataset:
  A sentiment analysis job about the problems of each major U.S. airline. Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors   were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or   "rude service").
* Dataset shape: 14640 rows, 15 columns

#### Questions to be Answered:
* Can we plot this dataset to see how sentiment and airline interact?
* Can we run our own sentiment analysis function to see if it matches the already labeled sentiment feature?
* If we run a clustering algorithm, will a natural pattern appear that corresponds to our three sentiment values?

#### Models and Methods Used:
* Data Cleaning: python and pandas
* Plotting Features: matplotlib and seaborn
* Text Cleaning and Sentiment Analysis: NLTK and TextBlob
* Clustering: TF-IDF Vectorizer, KMeans, SVD, TSNE
